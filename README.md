# neovim config

Nix-ified neovim configuration.

Take it for a spin with `nix run github:acrobertson/neovim-config`

[!NOTE]

> Nix is currently required to run this config. Eventually, I'll add a fallback setup for non-Nix environments.

## Acknowledgements

Much of this config is ~inspired by~ lifted from [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) ([Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim/blob/main/LICENSE)). Having used it for a while, I found a lot of the niceties around the LSPs and formatters hard to leave behind, so many of those utilities have been repurposed here with minor modifications.
